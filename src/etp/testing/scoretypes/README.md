Stripped down version of `/cms/grading/scoretypes/` in https://github.com/e-i-o/cms/.
Keep these in sync if you bother to. 

Removed things:
- anything to do with HTML
- anything to do with localization
- anything to do with public_testcases because that stuff is incomprehensible (and we never use non-public test cases)
- Sum because... just use GroupSum
